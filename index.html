  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    Hi, I’m <strong>Nagesh Bulbule</strong> — a full-stack software developer, proud farmer, and family man based in Pune, originally from Samangaon in Latur district, Maharashtra.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    With over <strong>10 years of experience in .NET, Angular, and SQL Server</strong>, I currently work as a senior engineer in an MNC. I specialize in building secure, scalable web applications and practical tech solutions — from enterprise dashboards to personal home-security systems powered by Raspberry Pi.
  </p>


  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    I’m also a hands-on farmer managing over <strong>15 acres of black soil farmland</strong> with sugarcane, soybean, and seasonal crops. I'm exploring new-age models like <strong>polyhouse farming, buffalo care, and guava orchards</strong>, blending tradition with technology.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    Outside work and farm, I love analyzing the stock market, experimenting with <strong>Flutter-based apps</strong>, and learning continuously. I'm also investing in long-term strategies, both in tech and finance — including equities, crypto, and systemized BTST trades.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    My family is my world — we’re raising two little ones with care and trying to make <strong>English a natural part of our home</strong>. I value simplicity, discipline, and balance — whether I’m writing code, nurturing a crop, or teaching my kids something new.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <strong>I believe in building things</strong> — software, farms, a secure home, and a good life. Let’s connect!
  </p>
